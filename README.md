# k-d_tree
k-d tree static/dynamic library
 - builds a k-d tree from a list of points.
 - searches the tree to find the node closest to a given (x, y) location.

Detailed Description

	This library finds the node nearest a given point (a random (x,y) point not belonging to the tree),
 	by traversing the tree and calculating the distance from each node visited to the input point. 
 	It keeps track of the bounding box of the region defined by each node in the tree and avoids
  	visiting nodes that we already know are farther away than the current minimum distance.

To start, type "make" in the terminal, giving an executable. 
To test, Run ->

	./basic your_file.csv point_x point_y



To generate a random dataset of "n_points" number of "x,y" coordinates, run ->

	python3 generate_random_points.py output_file.csv n_points



For additional make recipes -
Type the following commands for more builds

	1. make libshared
        Builds libkdtree as a shared library

  
	2. make libstatic
        Builds libkdtree as a static library

  
	3. make shared
        Creates executable from shared library.
	
        To test, 	Run ->	./shared your_file.csv point_x point_y

	
	4. make static
	Creates executable from static library.
	
        To test, 	Run ->	./static your_file.csv point_x point_y


	5. make clean 
	Cleans the directory.


Files Description
+ **kdtree.h**: Header file defining the libtree API
+ **kdtree.c**: Implementation for APIs
+ **kd_internals.h**: Header file for the internal functions to implement in kdtree.c
+ **output_file.csv**: set of points input files to test with
+ **generate_random_points.py**: Helper script to generate sets of test point input files
+ **TreeTester**: Executable that will test your libtree.so alongside the solution and print PASS or FAIL
    + The TreeTester executable was compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc; any Ubuntu / Debian Linux derivative **should** be able to use it just fine.
